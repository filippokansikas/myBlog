            <h2>Introduction to Golem</h2>
            <p>Golem is a decentralized marketplace for computing power built on blockchain technology. It enables users to rent out their unused computational resources to others who require processing power for various tasks, such as rendering CGI, machine learning, and scientific computations. By leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, Golem creates a trustless, peer-to-peer network that benefits both providers and consumers of computing resources.</p>
            
            <h2>How Golem Works</h2>
            <p>Golem operates as a distributed network where users can contribute their idle CPU and GPU power in exchange for Golem Network Tokens (GLM). The process involves three main participants:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Requestors</strong> – Individuals or businesses that require computational power for tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Providers</strong> – Users who offer their computing resources for rent.</li>
                <li><strong>Software Developers</strong> – Developers who create and distribute applications that utilize Golem’s network.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The network functions through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and security in transactions between requestors and providers. Payments are processed automatically using the GLM token, streamlining the exchange of computing services.</p>
            
            <h2>Use Cases of Golem</h2>
            <p>Golem has a wide range of applications across different industries, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rendering and Animation</strong>: Golem provides an affordable and efficient alternative for rendering CGI, making it useful for graphic designers and animators.</li>
                <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning</strong>: AI researchers can harness distributed computing resources for training complex models.</li>
                <li><strong>Scientific Computing</strong>: Researchers can execute large-scale computations without investing in expensive supercomputers.</li>
                <li><strong>Cryptographic and Blockchain Applications</strong>: Golem can be utilized for cryptographic research, blockchain node hosting, and other computationally demanding blockchain-related tasks.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>The Golem Network Token (GLM)</h2>
            <p>GLM is the native token of the Golem network and is used for transactions within the ecosystem. Initially launched as GNT, the token underwent a migration to GLM to comply with Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, enhancing compatibility with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and exchanges. Users can earn GLM by providing computing resources and use it to pay for services within the network.</p>
            
            <h2>Advantages of Golem</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decentralization</strong>: Unlike traditional cloud computing services, Golem is not controlled by a single entity, reducing the risk of censorship and failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost-Effectiveness</strong>: The peer-to-peer model enables competitive pricing, making it more affordable than conventional cloud computing services.</li>
                <li><strong>Security and Transparency</strong>: Transactions on the network are secured via Ethereum smart contracts, ensuring trust among participants.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Golem's network can grow indefinitely as more users join, increasing available computing power over time.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Challenges and Limitations</h2>
            <p>Despite its promising potential, Golem faces some challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adoption and Awareness</strong>: As a relatively new concept, it requires wider adoption to compete with centralized cloud computing providers.</li>
                <li><strong>Network Efficiency</strong>: Efficient task distribution and execution across a decentralized network remain an ongoing challenge.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Risks</strong>: While blockchain provides security, users still need to be cautious about potential vulnerabilities and exploits.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Golem represents an innovative approach to distributed computing, enabling anyone with spare computational power to monetize their resources while providing affordable processing power to those who need it. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, Golem has the potential to disrupt the traditional cloud computing market, offering a decentralized alternative for computing-intensive applications. While challenges remain, ongoing development and adoption could make Golem a key player in the decentralized computing space.</p>
